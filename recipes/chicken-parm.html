    <h2>Beautiful Chicken Parm</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for an original italian cuisine dish named Chicken Parm.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces unsalted raw almonds</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) jar pasta sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Blend almonds in a blender or food processor to the consistency of bread crumbs. Transfer ground almonds to a shallow dish and add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.</li>
    <li>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and pound, using a meat mallet, until about 1-inch thick.</li>
    <li>Press chicken into almond mixture until evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until a nice crust forms, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat pasta sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour over cooked chicken and top with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Turn on oven's broiler. Broil chicken Parmesan until cheese is bubbling and golden, about 3 minutes.</li>
